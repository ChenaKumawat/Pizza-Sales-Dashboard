# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard
In this Power BI dashboard, I've conducted a thorough analysis of pizza sales for a pizza store. The dashboard features key insights such as the top and bottom 5 pizzas based on revenue and quantity, total orders, and KPIs related to pizza categories. Users can explore sales trends on a daily and monthly basis, analyze the percentage of sales by pizza category and size, and view the total number of pizzas sold in each category.

The dashboard also highlights the busiest days and times, providing valuable information for optimizing operations and enhancing decision-making. With interactive features allowing for time selection, users can customize their exploration of the data for a more tailored and insightful experience.
